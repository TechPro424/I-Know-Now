**This mod requires Fabric API.**

I Know Now is a simple server-sided mod to let players know if an entity is targeting them.

A message is sent to the player in game whenever an entity starts targeting them, with the format `A <mobName> is targeting you (<distance> blocks away)`

## Credits
 - Huge shoutout to [robotkoer](https://modrinth.com/user/robotkoer) for creating and maintaining the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, as it was the only way I could play Minecraft properly! Without this modpack, I would have never played MC Java, and as a result, never gotten into modding the game.
 - Another huge shoutout to [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/@ModdingByKaupenjoe/) for his [Java Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1FeXvEogpjz4SvHxF_FJRO6) and [Minecraft Fabric Modding Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EMYzuBUTYjHnFeBrRFbesk) playlists! They're a great resource for anyone who wants to get started with Minecraft modding.
 - Thanks a lot to the Fabric community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/FabricMC/discussions) and to [Kaupenjoe's community on Discord](https://url.kaupenjoe.net/discord) for helping me out with the various issues I had when making this mod and tolerating my stupid mistakes. 

 **You may freely use this mod in any modpack, as long as the download remains hosted within the Modrinth ecosystem.**
